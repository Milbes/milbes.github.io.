				<h4 style="background-repeat: no-repeat;background-image: linear-gradient(rgba(255,255,255,0.72),rgba(255,255,255,0.72)),url(images/csusblogo.png);background-position: center;">The Muslim Student Association at California State University, San Bernardino has one mission: to work in the servitude of God Almighty. In striving to do so, the MSA intends to become from the people that are mentioned in the Noble Qur'an (Holy Book) in Chapter 3, Verse 102-104: "Let there become of you a nation who invite to all that is good, enjoin the doing of what is right and forbid what is wrong. Such are they who shall prosper."<br><br>

The purpose of the MSA is to educate students about Islam. It shall assist Muslim students in fulfilling their Islamic duty to promote Islamic values through various engaging means. It also aims to maintain a friendly atmosphere for positive interaction between Muslim students and other religious and social organizations on campus. We strive to conduct all affairs in accordance with the laws and guidelines, which are clearly written in the Noble Quran and expressed by the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in his Sunnah (oral and written traditions of the Prophet Muhammad).<br><br>

The MSA, in concordance with the Divine Laws of Islam, fully recognizes all religions and extends a friendly hand towards them. Furthermore, it holds high esteem for all opinions expressed in a respectful manner, but will not tolerate disrespect and/or hate speech directed towards Islam, nor any other religion or group.</h4>
