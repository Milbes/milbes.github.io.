				<h4>The MSA at CSUSB fosters a space for Muslim students on the CSUSB campus. The MSA provides religious services, advocates on behalf of Muslim students on campus, and provides opportunities for students to give back to their community.<br>

The MSA is a thriving student community engaging the campus and the greater society through community service, outreach, and educational projects. Its diverse constituencies find an environment away from home in the MSA that stretches far beyond simply an "organization." It is a community, a space where Muslim students can feel comfortable growing and engaging their campus in a focused manner. As a cultural group, MSA adds a valuable voice to CSUSB, one that speaks for its Muslim students, seeks to dispel harmful myths, and is committed to broadening horizons all around.<br>

As a community, MSA develops leaders who use their education as a tool with which to engage their peers and further empower themselves. As part of a whole, MSA strives to build bridges with other communities to maintain meaningful dialogues. Thus, the MSA is a cultural, social, political, and philanthropic vehicle that produces individuals who fulfill not only the vision of MSA, but ultimately the mission of USAC and the University as a whole. </h4>
